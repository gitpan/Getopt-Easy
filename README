Getopt-Easy version 0.1
========================

Getopt::Easy is a clear and simple alternative to Getopt::Std
and Getopt::Long.  It also provides a usage message, an option
for POD output, and a flexible debugging option.

INSTALLATION

To install this module on Unix and its variants,
take the Getopt-Easy-0.1.tar.gz file and do
the usual:

	% gunzip Getopt-Easy-0.1.tar.gz
	% tar xvf Getopt-Easy-0.1.tar
	% cd Getopt-Easy-0.1
	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test

	And assuming all went well,
	become super user to do the following:
	# make install

Since this is a pure Perl module you COULD install it manually.
Unzip the tar.gz file somehow and then make a Getopt subdirectory
somewhere on the default search paths (see perl -V and look
at the bottom for the @INC array).  Then copy
lib/Getopt/Easy.pm there.

For example, on Win32:
	
	Use Winzip to extract the files from the tar.gz file.
	lib/Getopt/Easy.pm will be among them.

	C:> perl -V
	...
	D:\Perl\lib
	D:\Perl\site\lib

	# make the Getopt directory:
	C:>md D:\Perl\site\lib\Getopt

	Copy  lib/Getopt/Easy.pm  to  D:\Perl\site\lib\Getopt

	That's all that is needed.
	Then you can do:

	C:> perldoc Getopt::Easy

	And use the module however you wish.
